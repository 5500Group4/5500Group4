## What would we do better next time
List the areas where you want to improve your presentation
- Time management: Some sections felt rushed while others were a bit long. This was mostly fixed in our actual presentation though. We can work on balancing time across the presentation from the very start next time.
- More Q&A preparation: We could prepare for potential questions more thoroughly to handle the audience's inquiries with more confidence.
