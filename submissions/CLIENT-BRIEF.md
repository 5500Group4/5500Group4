# High level problem description (`CLIENT-BRIEF.md`)

### Due date: Sep 27 by 5:59 PM

This document includes the high level description of the problem from our client, BC Cancer.


## Pain Points/Problems:

### 1. Manual and Repetitive Workload
- Fundraiser coordinators are manually updating and reviewing lists, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
- They also have to remind fundraisers to update these lists regularly, which adds to the administrative burden.

### 2. Ineffective List Management
- There's no easy way to filter or target specific invitees for events based on region, interests, or other factors.
- The current system lacks a way to track updates, changes, and reasons for removal from the invitee list, leading to confusion and errors.

### 3. Limited Usability of Current Spreadsheet
- The existing Excel-based system is cluttered with too many columns, making it difficult for fundraisers to navigate or retrieve relevant information.
- Column names are not intuitive, hindering the ability to filter data effectively by criteria like interests, region, or donor relationships (e.g., couples).
- There is no built-in search or filter functionality to help segment the list by region or interests, making it difficult to plan outreach.

### 4. Poor Donor Experience Management
- Fundraisers experience delays or inefficiencies when accessing the donor list, which may be due to VPN or system performance issues.
- Incomplete or outdated donor data impacts their ability to plan effective outreach and events.
- There is no way to record notes on why donors are removed from the list, which creates confusion during future outreach planning.

### 5. Lack of Donor Relationship Tracking
- The system lacks the ability to track donor relationships (e.g., couples), which can lead to duplicated outreach or incomplete data for planning purposes.
- There is also no way to track donor behavior with other foundations, which could help predict future donation trends or interests.
